Currently This is just a playground for a project I am working on. Cloning it will not result in the functional project.

While working on this project, I am using private, trademarked assets. As such, they will not be uploaded to this repo. If downloaded, you must provide the assets and data package. Or get it directly from me.

'data package' as referred to above is structured as follows and can be used to generate full dataset via settings menu
defaults.json
{
    "trainers": [
        ["Name","starter","staterForm","region","class"],...
    ],
    "mons": [
        {"name": "Name", "form": "form", "cost": 1, "unlocker": "Name"},...
    ]
}

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
Console loggable via browser

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
